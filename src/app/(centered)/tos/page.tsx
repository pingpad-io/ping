        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>By using Pingpad, you agree to comply with the following legally binding terms and conditions:</p>

        <h4>1. Compliance with Laws</h4>
        <p>
          Users must comply with all applicable US and EU laws while using our app. Any violation of these laws may
          result in the immediate termination of your account, and may also be reported to the relevant authorities.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Intellectual Property</h4>
        <p>
          The app's intellectual property, including its logo, name, website name, and other trademarks, are the
          exclusive property of the app and may not be used or reproduced without our express written consent. Any
          unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in legal action, including but not limited to civil
          lawsuits and criminal charges.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Reporting Policy Violations</h4>
        <p>
          Users are encouraged to report any violations of our policies to us by emailing
          <a href="mailto:contact@kualta.dev">contact@kualta.dev</a>. While we take reports seriously and review them
          carefully, we emphasize that Pingpad operates in a permissionless environment, and we cannot remove or
          restrict accounts or content on the underlying blockchain.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Disclaimer of Liability</h4>
        <p>
          The app is not responsible for any damage caused by users or content posted on the app. By using our app, you
          acknowledge and agree that you use the app at your own risk, and that we are not liable for any harm or damage
          caused by your use of the app.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Termination of Accounts</h4>
        <p>
          The app reserves the right to terminate access to its platform interface at any time, for any reason,
          including but not limited to violation of our policies or applicable laws. However, this does not affect the
          permissionless nature of the underlying environment, and users retain access through other means outside of
          our platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          By using our app, you acknowledge and agree to these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms,
          please refrain from using Pingpad.
        </p>
